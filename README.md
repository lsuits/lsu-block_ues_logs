# Add / Drop Tracking Plugin for UES

This is a block that tracks student adds and drops during the [UES] process.

Without actually modifiying the enrollment process, the block builds records
based on the enrollment diff during cron. The block provides a simple read only
access to the logs to all relevent users (Teachers, Admins, etc).
